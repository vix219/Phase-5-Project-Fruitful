##  Getting Started

### Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-tree-tracker.git
    cd fruit-tree-tracker
 
 ### Backend Setup:
    cd server
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    flask db upgrade  # Ensure migrations are applied
    python seed.py    # (Optional) Seed initial data
    python app.py     # Run Flask app

    React app runs at: http://localhost:3000

   
 ### Security Notes
    Passwords are stored hashed using Bcrypt

    Session management is done via Flask sessions (cookie-based)

    CORS is enabled for development (localhost:3000)

    No CSRF protection or role-based access control yet â€” not production-ready
